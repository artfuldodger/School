To create the admin user and the three roles, please run `rake db:seed`

This will create the following three roles:
- user
- moderator
- admin

The user role grants people basic access to the site. This role is granted to people who sign up by themselves.
The moderator role grants people ability to edit things submitted by other people.
The admin role can edit other things, delete things, and create new users and grant them any role.
